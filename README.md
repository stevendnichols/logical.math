Educational repo for arithmetic functions composed exclusively of logic operations

SUMMARY: What if your programming language included no operators for doing arithmetic? For example, no +,-,==,>,<,*,/,etc. In such a case, you would have to understand the logic underlying the arithmetic operations in order to perform these most basic tasks. This repository is a teaching tool demonstrating the logic behind such arithmetic operations. It is a work in progress, but I hope that it may prove useful in some way.
